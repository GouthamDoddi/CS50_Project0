# CS50_Project0
This is the first project within the CS50 web development program. 
I have created four html pages and used scss for styling.
I have also used Bootstrap4 ccdn links to use the bootstrap properties
such as navigation bar to navigate through pages.

# gallery.html
Here I have used Bootstrap4 grid system to 
scale my website according to the screen 
resolution.
I have also used css border properties here.

# about.html
I have made this page quite simple and used @media 
quarey property.
also I have @media to change the body color an all the pages.

# home.html
I have used css font-family to style the navbar-brand.
And clicking on the navbar-brand will take you to the 
home.html page.

# music
I have used nested list and a simple table here.
I have also used scss inheritence and nesting here.

Also I may not have covered all the details but 
I made sure I have meet all the requirements of the Project. 

abot the node modules. I think they were added when I instled and started using scss
